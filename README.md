# React Router II

In this challenge, route redirection, obtaining parameters on a route and assigning an active class to the route being visited in an SPA are applied.

Home and Personajes views: In Home, a welcome message is displayed and in Pokemones you can select a pokemon from a list, by clicking or typing the name and then pressing the "view detail" button will display information about the selected pokemon.

In case you do not select one or you access one that is not in the list (by typing it directly in the url) it will be redirected to the pokemon list.
